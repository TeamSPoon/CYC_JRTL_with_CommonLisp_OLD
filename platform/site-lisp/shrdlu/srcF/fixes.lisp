; The second fix for DEFPROP, based on the first,
; for the form where a property is defined as some other

; defines a function that operates on the remainder of the list of
; which it is a part and an "apply-" function that operates on a list.
; So if you defun-fexpr bob, you get a function that will work like
; this: (bob arg1 arg2 arg3 ... argn) and another like this:
; (apply-bob '(arg1 arg2 ... argn)).


; With the following rewrites:
; (defun bob fexpr (x) ...) as (defun-fexpr bob (x) ...)
; (apply 'bob stuff)        as (apply-bob stuff);
